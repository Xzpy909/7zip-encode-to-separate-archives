# 7zip-encode-to-separate-archives
7zip encode to separate archives workaround .bat file

how to use:
1. save the bat file to shell:sendto (WIN+R, type shell:sendto and put bat file here)
2. select folders -> send to -> compress separate.bat

# save as sebarate cbz archives
same logic but output will be cbz (manga archives - zip compression)
